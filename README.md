Description
===========

I like the user interface of [Qwit][1] but [Gwibber][2] seems superior in terms of features. To enjoy the benefits of both, I created a *Gwibber* theme based on the **compact** theme that comes with *Gwibber*. The theme resembles the message display of *Qwit* but is not an exact copy.

Requirements
============

* *Gwibber* with support for Version 2 Themes *(Tested with Gwibber 2.30)*

Installation
============

The theme can be installed either by creating a directory in the user's home directory or by copying to `/usr/share/gwibber/ui/themes/`. The first way is recommended and can be accomplished by opening a terminal and running the following commands:

    $ mkdir -p ~/.local/share/gwibber/ui/themes/
    $ cd ~/.local/share/gwibber/ui/themes/
    $ wget http://livoris.de/releases/gwibber-qwittheme.tar.gz
    $ tar -xvzf gwibber-qwittheme.tar.gz

After installing the theme, it can be activated by going to *Edit* -> *Preferences* -> *Style* and selected **qwit** as theme.

Acknowledgement
===============

The project is based on the great work of the [Gwibber][2] team, the [Qwit][1] developers and the [jQuery][3] project.
